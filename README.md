```

## üì¶ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

This project is optimized for Netlify deployment with frontend-only operation using mock data.

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "DroneFlow - Drone survey management system"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Build command: `vite build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Configuration**: The included `netlify.toml` handles routing and build settings.
